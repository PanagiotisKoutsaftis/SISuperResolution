# SISuperResolution

Here you can find all the code related to my Master's Thesis with title "Single Image Super-Resolution Techniques". 
 The purpose of the thesis is to implement several SISR algorithms and apply them to Satellite Imagery for Remote Sensing applications.
 We are going to implement different kinds of techniques from traditional image processing algorithms (with and without learning) to Deep Learning techniques such as CNN and GANs. 
 
This is an ongoing project so the code and the references are going to be enriched.
